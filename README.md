# Credit Card Fraud Detection 🔍💳

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using **Machine Learning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**. The dataset is highly imbalanced, so techniques like **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** were applied to handle class imbalance.  

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used  
- **Programming Language**: Python 🐍  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest  
- **Techniques Used**:  
  - Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
  - Feature Engineering  
  - Handling Imbalanced Data with SMOTE  
  - Model Evaluation (Precision, Recall, F1-score)  

## 📊 Key Insights & Results  
- Achieved **90%+ precision** in detecting fraudulent transactions.  
- Identified fraud patterns through **heatmaps & distribution plots**.  
- Compared multiple models and selected the best-performing one.
